        text: "UNIQUEER , the first NGO in Argentina dedicated to empowering the LGBTIQA+ community through art and culture, published its 2023 Annual Sustainable Development Report , marking a year of expansion, impact and solidarity. Under the symbol of the unicorn, which represents the unity and uniqueness of identities within the LGBTIQA+ community, Uniqueer has carried out a series of transformative initiatives that highlight the power of art as a tool for social change. 2023 was a year where UNIQUEER challenged limits and expanded its horizons, making the first large-scale sculpture for diversity by the artists Galaxia & Mar, and landing in the United States with “ UNIQUEER de Troya” during Miami Art Week, a collaboration with Alfredo Segatori. These pieces not only symbolize inclusion and diversity but also promote sustainability and artistic innovation. In addition to these large-scale projects, Uniqueer has undertaken medium and small-scale production of Uniqueers, collaborating with LGBTIQA+ artists and using art to support both creators and community organisations. This year, 23 small-scale Uniqueers found new homes, and the funds raised helped boost initiatives such as the Trans Argentinxs Foundation's TransEmpleo program and the Hotel Gondolín cooperative space. In the field of artistic production, UNIQUEER has marked its presence in international fairs and exhibitions, such as the BADA Fair and the Hotel InterContinental Buenos Aires, promoting the inclusion and visibility of the LGBTIQA+ community through artistic and cultural experiences that resonated deeply. with the public. The organization has also conducted more than 1,250 hours of training in companies, using art as a creative tool to inspire reflection and foster dialogues about diversity. Among the companies that trusted Uniqueer are recognized names such as Cargill, Four Seasons Hotel and Banco Hipotecario, showing a growing commitment to building a more diverse and inclusive world. Looking to the future,  UNIQUEER  has outlined its Strategic Objectives for 2024, with plans to institutionalize its structure, promote inclusion through new editions of small-scale Uniqueers, expand its visibility internationally and create the Inclusive Development Directorate and Organizational. These goals underscore Uniqueer's dedication to using art as a means to problematize our environment and build more inclusive societies. Uniqueer's 2023 Activity Report is a testament to how art and culture can serve as powerful tools of social transformation, promoting a more inclusive and diverse world. With projects that challenge boundaries and expand horizons, Uniqueer continues its mission to transform the world through art, trusting the LGBTIQA+ community, artists and its own rebellion to achieve a lasting impact.",

        text: "The Unicx Civil Association project seeks to build a creative and productive circuit that promotes the integration of the most vulnerable populations through art and cultural management. Inspired by the CowParade – the famous colorful cows that toured the world –  Facundo Suárez , president of the Unicx Civil Association, decided to promote  sculptures that make the LGBTIQ+ community visible . This is how the  unicorns  were born , intervened by artists mainly from the transvestite population, exhibited and sold for solidarity purposes. The unicorns were born from an identity search: “We had to identify that icon that represents the community and that's how we arrived at this symbol. We also find in these mythological beings different aspects that make sense with our idea of  ​​participatory and collaborative work with solidarity missions ,” Suárez told TN.com.ar.  In the first edition of “Sculptures for Diversity” they called for recognized artists who could donate their work and contribute that money to the Association's objectives. With the proceeds from the event they were able  to help more than 500 transvestites in the midst of the pandemic.  “We were not looking to generate welfare, but something of that ended up happening. And that is because there is a problem with the transvestite population's access to the visual arts. Therefore, for this year, we are working on these themes and we have new objectives,” Suárez explained. Both recognized and emerging artists from the LGBTIQ+ community, especially the transvestite population, participate in this second edition. In this way, they become part of a cultural framework. However, to solve the problem of the lack of money to buy supplies and so that they have the freedom to  create without conditions,  “we give emerging artists an economic incentive and in turn we offer them artistic residency within  El cultural San Martín .” On this occasion, part of the proceeds from the sale of the works returns to the artists as an honorarium. “They can then decide if they want it or donate it to the solidarity mission,” said the Graduate of Performing Arts (UNA). The curatorship of Feda Baeza, against marginalization and stigmatization In this second edition, the artistic curatorship carried out by the current director of the Palais de Glace  Feda Baeza , will feature the participation of Lolo and Lauti, Ulises Mazzuca, Cartón Pintura and adds transvestite/trans artists to the creation of works, attempting in this way way to promote their visibility and generate effective resources through the sale of their creations. In addition, the proceeds will be used to generate funds for the development of the Employability Program for the Transvestite Trans population that Unicx will work with other civil society organizations. “The idea of ​​the curatorship was to convene a plural group of artists who, from diverse perspectives, agree on the need to show life trajectories that question heteropatriarchy and are interested in imagining  a community in which sexual dissidence is neither marginalized nor stigmatized.” ”Baeza summarized in the curatorial text. The director of the Palais de Glace told what motivated her to join “Sculptures for Diversity”: “First of all to make my queer identity visible as a political gesture. Secondly, for the conviction that it is necessary to help the LGBTIQ+ refugee community and, specifically, the trans community who, due to their structural conditions in our society,  suffer more strongly from the denial of their rights  in a difficult scenario like the current one.” . Virtual and in-person exhibition, and a human rights discussion From November to the end of December, the pieces will be exhibited in person in the Vertical Room of the Cultural San Martín. In November – Pride Month – there will be different activations in the square of that art space. On the other hand, an augmented reality platform will also be inaugurated   to display the works. “Virtuality allows us to amplify the reach of the cultural industry. A virtual museum that allows the pieces to be exhibited and give visibility to artists, especially emerging artists. In this way we can open channels of dialogue and, above all, stress the problems of emerging artists in the arts,” said Suárez. Unicx also plans a discussion on Art, Human Rights and Inclusion  with references from these three areas: “In this event we proposed not only to promote inclusion through art, but also to establish debate and reflect on the  access problems of dissidents to the cultural sector ”. The meeting will take place on September 8 and the curator Feda Baeza will participate; the director of Amnesty International Argentina Mariela Belski; artists Chiachio & Giannone and Cynthia Cohen; the director of El cultural San Martín and the president of Unicx. The heterocis view in art and the need for global change Suárez highlights and  questions the cis-gender Eurocentric view in the history of Argentine art , therefore, he seeks to contribute his grain of sand to accompany the change that is needed: “We also reflect this through action, by incorporating trans and non-binary transvestite artists to the intervention of unicorns, supporting their creation, visibility and remuneration for their work.” “Our organization is strengthened, consolidated, weaves networks and thus grows to continue transforming realities. We bet on art as a mode of expression and through there we establish a political position towards the construction of a diverse and inclusive society,” said Suárez. UNICX is a Civil Association that creates and disseminates artistic projects related to diversity, taking the visibility and inclusion of the LGBTIQ+ community as a transversal axis. Its mission is to generate a creative and productive circuit that promotes the integration of the most vulnerable populations through art and cultural management.",

This strategic location in the Retiro neighborhood will be the exhibition space for three months and will continue to focus on the campaign for the visibility and inclusion of the LGBTIQ+ community in the workplace. The work “Hire me as bright as I am” by the artists Galaxia and Mar is the icon that Uniqueer exposes to refer to the access problems of the Transvestite – Trans population in the workplace. This unicorn challenges guests and visitors about conventional notions of employment by presenting resumes embedded in its magical horn. They are resumes of people who break cisgender stereotypes and who want to be hired as they are. This special month highlights the importance of each person and their identity. That is why the goal is to be art facilitators, encouraging work spaces to be more open and respectful while bringing queer art to new audiences. It is worth mentioning that the sculpture, like the 27 generated in these 5 years, is for sale and the funds are intended to finance programs that strengthen the labor inclusion of the LGBTIQ+ community.',
